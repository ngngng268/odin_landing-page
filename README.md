# odin_landing-page
this is my exercise for The Odin Project.
I just finished the foundations for css. Flex still confuses me frequently, I'll try my best
Unlike the recipes page, I don't know if I'll come back to this project. Since I don't know if I'll really have a chance to do better, I'll try my best now with this project.

Thank you for reading. I hope I can travel further down this path.
